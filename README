# Earliest Deadline First Algorithm Simulation

A C implementation of the earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm simulating how a single-core CPU may schedule proccesses.

Fun Fact: EDF is called an "optimal" algorithm and is commonly implemented as an initial scheduling algorithm for operating systems before a more complicated one is available.
